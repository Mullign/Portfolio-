I am a versatile and goal-oriented professional with a Bachelor's degree in Construction Management from Kent State University and a strong foundation in project management, estimation, and technical problem-solving.
After years of managing complex construction projects and leading my own business, I am now pivoting my career toward the dynamic field of cybersecurity.
My experience managing the Progressive Field restoration project as a Project Manager gave me a deep understanding of coordinating complex operations, ensuring safety compliance,
and handling technical documentation—all essential skills in the cybersecurity industry. I’ve cultivated sharp attention to detail, strategic thinking, and the ability to work under pressure,
which I now aim to apply in protecting digital infrastructures.
As I pursue opportunities in cybersecurity, I bring a passion for safeguarding systems and information. My technical expertise, developed through hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and systems,
is complemented by a problem-solving mindset and an aptitude for learning new technologies. I’m eager to leverage my diverse skill set, from construction project management to my proficiency with technology and
data security, to contribute to the protection and resilience of modern digital environments.
